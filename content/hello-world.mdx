# Introduction

This is a sample post. Here is how we verify that **Prism** is working with **Tailwind**.

## Code Snippet

Check out this TypeScript code:

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

const getUser = (id: number): User => {
  return {
    id,
    name: 'Rohan',
  };
};

console.log(getUser(1));
```

## Styling

Since we used `@tailwindcss/typography`, lists look great too:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
