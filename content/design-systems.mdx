# Introduction

Design systems are more than just a **Figma** library. They are the language your team uses to build products.

## The Problem with Hex Codes

Using raw hex codes like `#3b82f6` in your codebase is a recipe for disaster.

```typescript
// ❌ Bad
const Button = styled.button`
  background: #3b82f6;
`;

// ✅ Good (Using Tokens)
const Button = styled.button`
  background: var(--color-primary-500);
`;
